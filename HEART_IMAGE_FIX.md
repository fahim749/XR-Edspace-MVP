# Heart Image Tracking Fix - Verification

## Problem
The AR experience was tracking the old "soft mind" marker image instead of the current heart marker image (`test_marker.png`).

## Root Cause
The `targets.mind` file is a compiled version of the AR tracking marker. When the marker image was changed from the heart diagram to a different image and then back to the heart, the `targets.mind` file was not recompiled to match the current marker.

## Solution
1. Restored the original heart marker image (PNG, 674x372 pixels) from commit 66ef825
2. Recompiled the `targets.mind` file using the MindAR compiler to match the current heart marker
3. Added `.gitignore` to prevent committing build artifacts
4. Added `package.json` with dependencies needed for future recompilation

## Files Changed
- `test_marker.png`: Restored to the original heart diagram (61KB PNG)
- `targets.mind`: Recompiled to track the heart diagram (250KB)
- `.gitignore`: Added to exclude build artifacts (node_modules, etc.)
- `package.json`: Added with `mind-ar` and `canvas` dependencies for compilation

## Verification
The following hashes confirm the correct files are in place:

```
test_marker.png:  10b1bd5e7d8a55adc5df43eb9336eaac (674x372 PNG - heart diagram)
targets.mind:     67d9ea832653577d5ed6a83ff115376b (compiled for heart diagram)
```

## How to Test
1. Open the AR experience in a browser: `https://fahim749.github.io/XR-Edspace-MVP/index.html`
2. Point your camera at the heart diagram marker image
3. The 3D heart model should appear and be properly tracked

## How to Recompile (if needed in the future)
If you change the marker image in the future, you need to recompile the `targets.mind` file:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start a local server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

3. Open `compile-browser.html` in a browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/compile-browser.html
   ```

4. Wait for compilation to complete (shows "âœ“ Compilation complete!")

5. Download the compiled `targets.mind` file and replace the existing one in the repository

Note: The offline compilation scripts (compile-*.mjs) have issues with the canvas package in Node.js. Use the browser-based compilation method instead.
